## Arizona

The U.S. State Department has declared the state of Arizona is a main destination and transit point for labor and sex trafficking, both nationally and internationally. Because of Arizona’s proximity to Mexico, San Diego and Las Vegas, the warm weather, infrastructure and freeways, and is the preferred venue for major conferences and a lot of professional sporting events, human trafficking has been very prevalent. 

According to the National Human Trafficking Hotline, Phoenix ranked 16th on the list in 2016 with 478 calls, making up 1.76 percent of calls nationwide. Of the human trafficking cases called in, eighty percent of the individuals trafficked were women and girls. The average age of human trafficking victims of sexual exploitation is 19 years old. Because of this, Arizona has some of the toughest human trafficking arrest laws anywhere in the nation.

In Arizona, a person found guilty of human trafficking will face felony charges.

However, the specific charges faced depend entirely upon the type of trafficking:

<b>Unlawfully obtaining labor or services is a class 4 felony.</b>
It is illicit to obtain labor or services through the use of bodily harm, threatening or restraining victim, and/or withholding victim’s personal records.

<b>Trafficking forced labor or services is a class 2 felony.</b>
Labor trafficking is defined as “transport another person or to entice, recruit, harbor, provide or otherwise obtain another person for transport by deception, coercion or force,”. Arizona Laws also state that it is illegal to knowingly traffic another person or benefit from the trafficking of another person for labor or services.

</b>Sex trafficking is a class 2 felony</b>
Arizona Laws dictate that it is illegal to recruit, entice, harbor, transport, provide or obtain by any means another person with the intent of causing the other person to engage in prostitution by force, fraud or coercion. If a person is under the age of eighteen, it is illegal to entice, harbor, transport, provide, or obtain by any means that person with the intent of causing that person to engage in prostitution.

<b>House Bill 2454 from 2014 was introduced to stop human trafficking by raising the penalties and improving the protective measures that both victims and vulnerable individuals are entitled to. </b> According to the Bill, the sentence for a first-time offender is increased from 10.5 to 13.5 years in prison. A trafficker who has a previous felony conviction will see a longer sentence of 25 instead of 15.75 years. The sentence for people who have two or more prior felonies is increased from 28 to 31 years.

The severity of the penalty will depend on the aggravating factors. Trafficking of children and minors are the ones prosecuted most severely. 

Prison sentences can vary greatly, from many years to many decades depending on the specifics of the case
Fines can be up to millions of dollars, not counting civil liabilities and judgments you may incur if you are found guilty
In the fight against human trafficking, House Bill 2454 also introduced additional changes to previous human trafficking laws. The key ones include:

It is considered an aggravating offense if a trafficker obtained a victim from a shelter for runaway youth, foster care, homeless persons or victims of human trafficking, domestic violence or sexual assault.
